# Particles and Noise

A demonstration of particle systems and noise in Unity3D. The fire in the scene is represented with a particle system which reacts to audio.
When the birds in the background chirp loudly, the fire reacts by launching a big fireball.
The grass in the scene is created using a ShaderGraph, which uses a noise function to create a swaying effect.
The parameters of this effect are controlled by the keyboard.

All of the shaders and scripts used in this project are included in the Assets folder.
